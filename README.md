## How to run locally

### Configure the .env File

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

> [!NOTE]
> The repository includes .env.example as a template with default settings. Your actual .env file is excluded from version control (via .gitignore) to prevent accidentally committing sensitive information like passwords and specific settings.

Edit the `.env` file with the editor of your choice
